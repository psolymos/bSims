<p>The <strong>bSims</strong> R package is a <em>highly scientific</em>
and <em>utterly addictive</em> bird point count simulator. Highly
scientific, because it implements a spatially explicit mechanistic
simulation that is based on statistical models widely used in bird point
count analysis (i.e. removal models, distance sampling), and utterly
addictive because the implementation is designed to allow rapid
interactive exploration (via <strong>shiny</strong> apps) and efficient
simulation (supporting various parallel backends), thus elevating the
user experience.</p>

estimation. <em>Biologia Futura</em> 74, 377–392 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s42977-023-00183-2" class="external-link">DOI

<p>The goals of the package are to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>allow easy <em>testing of statistical assumptions</em> and explore
effects of violating these assumptions,</li>
<li>
<em>aid survey design</em> by comparing different options,</li>
<li>and most importantly, to <em>have fun</em> while doing it via an
intuitive and interactive user interface.</li>
</ol>
<p>The simulation interface was designed with the following principles
in mind:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>isolation</em>: the spatial scale is small (local point count
scale) so that we can treat individual landscapes as more or less
homogeneous units (but see below how certain stratified designs and edge
effects can be incorporated) and independent in space and time;</li>
<li>
<em>realism</em>: the implementation of biological mechanisms and
observation processes are realistic, defaults are chosen to reflect
common practice and assumptions;</li>
<li>
<em>efficiency</em>: implementation is computationally efficient
utilizing parallel computing backends when available;</li>
<li>
<em>extensibility</em>: the package functionality is well documented
and easily extensible.</li>
</ol>
<p>This documents outlines the major functionality of the package. First
we describe the motivation for the simulation and the details of the
layers. Then we outline an interactive workflow to design simulation
studies and describe how to run efficient simulation experiments.
Finally we present some of the current limitations of the framework and
how to extend the existing functionality of the package to incorporate
more of the biological realism into the simulations.</p>

</h2>
<p>Point-count surveys are one of the most widely used survey techniques
for birds. This method involves an observer standing at a location and
recording all the birds that are detected during a set amount of time
within a fixed or unlimited distance away from the observer. The data
collected this way are often used in trend monitoring, assessing
landscape and climate change effects on bird populations, and setting
population goals for conservation.</p>
<p>Point counts provide an index of the true abundance at the survey
location due to imperfect detection. A plethora of design and model
based solutions exist to minimize the impacts and account for the biases
due to imperfect detection. Contrary to the importance of point counts
among other field methods for landbirds, there is no generally
applicable simulation tool that would help better understand the
possible biases and would help in aiding survey design.</p>
<p>Currently available simulation tools are either concerned by movement
trajectories of bird flocks to mitigate mortality near airports and wind
farms or are very specific to statistical models. Statistical techniques
are expected to provide unbiased estimates when the data generation
process follows the assumptions of the model. However, testing if the
model assumptions are realistic is rarely evaluated with the same
rigor.</p>
<p>The apparent lack of general purpose simulation tools for point
counts can probably be attributed to the fact that reality is very
complex in these situations and it is not immediately straightforward
how to best tackle this complexity. To illustrate this claim, here is
how ecological modellers approach bird density. Counts (Y) are described
by the marginal distribution, e.g. Y ~ Poisson(DApq) where D is density
(abundance per unit area), A is the survey area, p is the probability of
individuals being available for sampling, whereas q is the detection
probability given availability. Such a model is also viewed as a mixture
distribution: N ~ Poisson(DA), Y ~ Binomial(N, pq). This gives a
straightforward algorithm for generating counts under known D, A, p, q
parameters, that can in turn be used to test statistical performance
(unbiasedness, consistency) of N-mixture, time-removal, and distance
sampling models among others.</p>
<p>Reality, however, is often more complicated. Take for example
roadside counts, which served as the main motivations for developing the
simulation approaches presented in here. Bird surveys along roads are
widespread due to logistical, safety, and cost considerations. This is
the case, even though differences between roadside and off-road counts
are well documented.These differences indicate a roadside bias due to,
e.g., density, behavior and detectability being different depending on
the distance from the road. Understanding the nature and sources of
roadside count bias might not lend itself to simple simulations based on
the marginal distributions. Understanding roadside counts requires a
spatially explicit and more mechanistic simulation approach.</p>
<p>The bSims R package presents a spatially explicit mechanistic
simulation framework. Its design is informed by statistical models
widely used in the analyses of bird point count data (i.e. removal
models, distance sampling). The implementation allows real time
interactive exploration via Shiny apps followed by efficient simulations
supporting various parallel backends.</p>
<p>The goals of the package are to (1) allow easy testing of statistical
assumptions and explore the effects of violating these assumptions; to
(2) aid survey design by comparing different options; and (3) to have
fun while doing this.</p>
<p>In this paper, we demonstrate the main functionality of the package,
then outline the interactive workflow to design and efficiently run
simulation experiments, finally we present future directions to extend
the existing functionality of the package by incorporating more
biological realism into the simulations.</p>

<p>The simulation interface was designed with the following principles
in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolation: the spatial scale is small (local point count scale) so
that we can treat individual landscapes as more or less homogeneous
units (but see below how certain stratified designs and edge effects can
be incorporated) and independent in space and time;</li>
<li>Realism: the implementation of biological mechanisms and observation
processes are realistic, defaults are chosen to reflect common practice
and assumptions;</li>
<li>Efficiency: implementation is computationally efficient utilizing
parallel computing backends when available;</li>
<li>Extensibility: the package functionality is well documented and
easily extensible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going back to the Poisson–Binomial example, N would be a result of
all the factors influencing bird abundance, such as geographic location,
season, habitat suitability, number of conspecifics, competitors, or
predators. Y, however, would largely depend on how the birds behave
depending on the time of the day, or how the observer might detect or
miss the different individuals, or count the same individual twice,
etc.</p>
<p>This series of conditional filtering of events lends itself to be
represented as layers. These simulation layers are conditionally
independent of each other. This design can facilitate the comparison of
certain settings while keeping all the underlying layers of the
realizations identical. This can help pinpointing the effects without
the extra variability introduced by all the other underlying layers.</p>
<p>The bSims package implements the following main ‘verb’ functions for
simulating the conditionally independent layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initialize (<code>bsims_init</code>): the landscape is defined by
the extent and possible habitat stratification;</li>
<li>Populate (<code>bsims_populate</code>): the population of finite
number of individuals within the extent of the landscape;</li>
<li>Animate (<code>bsims_animate</code>): individual behaviors described
by movement and vocalization events, i.e. the frequency of sending
various types of signals;</li>
<li>Detect (<code>bsims_detect</code>): the physical side of the
observation process, i.e. transmitting and receiving the signal;</li>
<li>Transcribe (<code>bsims_transcribe</code>): the “human” aspect of
the observation process, i.e. the perception of the received
signal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>bsims_</code> part of the function helps finding the
functions via autocomplete functionality of the developer environment,
such as RStudio VSCode. In the next sections we will review the main
options available for each of the simulation layers (see Appendix for
worked examples and reproducible code).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#limitations"></a>
</h2>
<p>The package is not equipped with all the possible ways to estimate
the model parameters. It only has rudimentary removal modeling and
distance sampling functionality implemented for the interactive
visualization and testing purposes. Estimating parameters for more
complex situations (i.e. finite mixture removal models, or via Hazard
rate distance functions) or estimating abundance via multiple-visit
N-mixture models etc. is outside of the scope of the package and it is
the responsibility of the user to make sure those work as expected.</p>
<p>Other intentional limitation of the package is the lack of reverse
interactions between the layers. For example the presence of an observer
could influence behavior of the birds close to the observer. Such
features can be implemented as methods extending the current
functionality.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that this implementation considers single
species. Observers rarely collect data on single species but rather
count multiple species as part of the same survey. The commonness of the
species, observer ability, etc. can influence the observation process
when the whole community is considered. Such scenarios are also not
considered at present. Although the same landscape can be reused for
multiple species, and building up the simulation that way.</p>
<p>The package considers simulations as independent in space and time.
When larger landscapes need to be simulated, there might be several
options: (1) simulate a larger extent and put multiple independent
observers into the landscape; or (2) simulate independent landscapes in
isolation. The latter approach can also address spatial and temporal
heterogeneity in density, behaviour, etc. E.g. if singing rate is
changing as a function of time of day, one can define the
<code>vocal_rate</code> values as a function of time, and simulate
independent animation layers. When the density varies in space, one can
simulate independent population layers.</p>
<p>These limitations can be addressed as additional methods and modules
extending the capabilities of the package, or as added functionality to
the core layer functions in future releases.</p>
